<h2>What is Bioresonance?</h2>
<p>Bioresonance is a biophysics based test and therapy method that uses electromagnetic frequencies generated by the body to detect the presence of parasites, bacteria, viruses, toxins, food intolerances, allergies of all kinds and to help eliminating them. It is a non-invasive, painless and gentle therapy making it suitable for children and babies. It has been an empirical method of diagnosis and treatment for more than 30 years. It is a form of biofeedback therapy.</p>
<h2>Can Bioresonance benefit me?</h2>
<p>Bioresonance is particularly useful in treating patients with intractable eczema, asthma, food intolerances, chronic fatigue, recurrent chest/ear infections, digestive system disorders, Autoimmune disorders, heavy metal toxicities, insomnia, headaches and migraines, ADHD and Autistic Spectrum Disorders.</p>
<h2>How does Bioresonance work?</h2>
<p>Discoveries made in quantum biophysics have revealed that all particles of matter share the characteristics of both waves and particles. This means that all substances – and therefore all cells in all parts of the body, as well as viruses, bacteria, pollen, toxins, etc. – emit electromagnetic waves. Depending upon their nature, all substances have their specific wavelength or frequency with highly individual characteristics. This is known as a frequency pattern, which can be detected by Bioresonance devices. Bioresonance therapy does not cure illnesses. The principle of the therapy is to eliminate the root cause of the disease, reduce patient’s toxic load and enhance body’s self-healing capacity.</p>
<p>It is a form of bioregulatory medicine. Within complementary medicine, bioresonance therapy is recognised as an effective method of treatment method. However, a greater archive of evidence is required to prove Bioresonance's well-deserved place within the world of conventional medicine.</p>
