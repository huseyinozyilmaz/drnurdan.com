<h2>What is Bioregulation Therapy (BRT)?</h2>
<p>Bioregulation Therapy (BRT) is a non-invasive, safe and effective modality that uses advanced biofeedback and pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) technology to support biological communications at the cellular level – ultimately helping the body to better self-regulate, adapt and heal naturally. It is a non-invasive, painless and gentle therapy making it suitable for children and babies. It has been an empirical method of diagnosis and treatment for more than 30 years.</p>
<h2>Can BRT benefit me?</h2>
<p>BRT is particularly useful in treating patients with intractable eczema, asthma, food intolerances, chronic fatigue, recurrent chest/ear infections, digestive system disorders, Autoimmune disorders, heavy metal toxicities, insomnia, headaches and migraines, ADHD and Autistic Spectrum Disorders.</p>
<h2>How does BRT work?</h2>
<p>Discoveries made in quantum biophysics have revealed that all particles of matter share the characteristics of both waves and particles. This means that all substances – and therefore all cells in all parts of the body, as well as viruses, bacteria, pollen, toxins, etc. – emit electromagnetic waves. Depending upon their nature, all substances have their specific wavelength or frequency with highly individual characteristics. This is known as a frequency pattern, which can be detected by BRT devices. BRT therapy does not cure illnesses. The principle of the therapy is to eliminate the root cause of the disease, reduce patient’s toxic load and enhance body’s self-healing capacity.</p>
